				HELPFILE for ChkBk Version 1.54

Thanks for using ChkBk....Enjoy!

 The recommended terminal size settings to use ChkBk are at least 115x40 or just make it full screen.
	The program should look fine at the usual default settings of 80x24
	but will look ugly when you try to check your balance.


DEPENDENCIES
	Bourne Shell (sh) and AWK and a printer if you want to print (which implies
		printer software such as CUPS)
	Hint: If you are using linux or one of the BSD's you probably already have these.


INSTALLATION

	ChkBk as of version 1.2 has an install script. It can be run as root or as a normal
	user.  If run as root, the installer will attempt to make a .chkbk directory in all users
	homes if their homes are located in /home. The installer will then install the main chkbk
	program to /usr/local/bin. Obviously, these values can be changed by editing the install.sh
	script-more on this in CONFIGURATION below.
	If run as a normal user, the installer will ask if the user wants to make a .chkbk
	directory in his/her home and install the chkbk program to $HOME/bin and update .bash_profile(linux)
	to reflect the new path, if necessary.  The alternate choice for installing as normal user is 
	to just make a chkbk directory in the user's home and put chkbk in there.
	
	
	Linux/BSD (replace <version> with chkbk version you downloaded)
	- extract the archive:
		tar xvzf chkbk-<version>.tar.gz
	- change to chkbk directory
		cd chkbk-<version>
	- run install script
		./install.sh
	
	
	Windows
	- install cygwin
		http://cygwin.com/setup.exe

	- make sure you install and awk/gawk with cygwin (should be installed by default)

	- then extract the archive using winrar or some other exrtraction utility
		into your cygwin home folder (default location
		is c:\cygwin\home\<username> )
	- start cygwin
		double-click Cygwin icon on desktop
	- change to directory you named chkbk when you extracted it (HINT: type ls at the
	  command prompt if you don't know what it is. You should see something referring 
	  to chkbk)
	  	type: cd chkbk-<version>
		  or 
		cd <directory that shows up when you type ls above>
	- run install script
		./install.sh

	- NOTE: there is a problem with the PATH not getting exported
	  in Windows. This means that even if you choose the "bin" install,
	  you will not be able to run chkbk by just typing "chkbk" at the
	  prompt. To work around this just copy the chkbk script to the
	  /usr/local/bin directory under where cygwin is installed.
		Example:
		cp bin/chkbk /usr/local/bin  	

CONFIGURATION

	It is possible to change the default values for things such as the
	default location to save the database to by changing the variable 
	constants at the start of the chkbk or install.sh script:
	  ex. to change the place where is chk.db is backed up to
		by default, open up chkbk and edit the line:
		C_DEFAULT="chk.db.bak" 
			to say
		C_DEFAULT="path to wherever you wanna save to"
	
	If your users home directories are in a different location other than /home,
	you need to edit install.sh functions makehomes() and gethomes() to reflect 
	the alternate location. For example,
	default find homes command in gethomes():
		homes="$(ls /home | grep -v "lost+found" > "$TMP")"
	if your homes are in /mnt/data/home, change this to:
		homes="$(ls /mnt/data/home | grep -v "lost+found" > "$TMP")"

	The location where chkbk is installed as root is in the CHKBK_ROOT_BIN variable
	in the variables section of the script. There are other things here, but changing 
	them is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing :)

	
USAGE
	
	To run ChkBk:
	If you installed as root or normal user with the "bin" option,
	- just type chkbk at the prompt as any user
	
	If you installed as normal user with "alt" option(i.e, installed to $HOME/chkbk
	not $HOME/.chkbk)
	
	- change to the directory where chkbk is located:
		cd /home/<username>/chkbk
	- run the script chkbk
		./chkbk

	Menu Navigation
	- To choose a feature just select the letter surrounded by
	  parentheses-except for the copyright logo (C), obviously.
	- Typing '"h"' in most any menu field will bring open the help file.
	- When in the dposit or withdrawal screens for savings or checking,
	  enter a "q" in any field and you will exit back to the menu.
	  If you make a mistake in one of the fields just hit enter and either
	  the field will clear or move to the next field.  If the cursor moves
	  to the next field just type a dash "-" and the previous field will
	  cleared and the cursor will move there for you to re-enter the data.
	- When in doubt of how to leave a screen type a "q"

KNOWN BUGS

	This system has been tested on various linux distributions, OpenBSD,
	Mac OS X, Windows (under CYGWIN). It has been found not to work
	properly on FreeBSD due to FreeBSD's implemention of tput. 
	
	Mac OS - only "alt" install works
	Windows - PATH soes not update properly during "bin" install as normal
		user.
